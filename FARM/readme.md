### FARM Stack
Fast API (BackEnd), React (FrontEnd Client), MongoDB (DataBase)

FARM Stack is simmilar to the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS) stack or MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS) stack,
the difference from MERN is using FastAPI and from MEAN its also not using Angular.

FastAPI is a modern and fast framework for webAPIs, this is done by using ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface),
and the responsetime is superior to Express. FastAPI also has better documentation that lets you test get, post, put and delete visually.

React is the most popular javaScript frontEnd framework
